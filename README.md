Sleep apnea detection hardware project "aram" being done with the camera culture group, MIT Media Lab
This repo currently tracks my development of a reflective forehead pulse oximeter - a very crucial component of this entire setup.

Japanese Radio Corporation's NJL5501 sensor is being investigated for use as the sensor for this setup.
